## Mod has been discontinued
Mod support has been finished since the game implemented all the features (excepting buying) lifters. Note that the lifters model may come in a future mod again!

# MoreLifters
This repository contains the source code for the My Garage mod MoreLifters. 

## Features:
- 2 new types of lifters (small and large). You start with a small one and a large one, these are located next to the gas station.
- You can move them with a move tool.
- Ability to carry them in a trailer. (Note that you can only use a car trailer to move them)
- Ability to buy as much lifters as you want. (The store is located in the beach)
- Slider jacks! You can just lift a part of the car, useful when working with suspensions.
- Save and load support, including barn support: When you save with a car in the lifter it will load as you leaved it!
- Configurable settings: You can disable game's default lifter and also use a ramp or ramp-less lifter model.
- Open source (GitHub)
